Big Mart Sales Prediction

In this project, data pertaining to the sales of the products from various outlets is applied using machine learning techniques. In order to forecast the sales of a certain shop, we will use a total of 12 attributes from the dataset. The major goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate product sales in the shop with accuracy, allowing store managers to make deft choices regarding inventory control, sales forecasting, and marketing tactics. For this endeavour, methods like linear regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest regression are used.

The Code folder contains the Google Colab file in which we have implemented the whole project.

The Dataset folder contains the dataset file used in the project.

The results folder contains the screenshots of the outcomes of the machine learning models.

The Reports folder contains the mid-semester and end-semester reports and a subfolder named "Weekly Reports".

The Presentation folder contains the mid-semester and end-semester presentations.
